# Simulated data
This directory contains R scripts to generate some simple genotype and
gene expression data. The aim is to illustrate ideas behind a basic
eQTL analysis and issues that may arise in a controlled setting. No
serious attempt is made to make the simulated data particularly
realistic. The focus is on specific problems, e.g. confounding 
variation and its effect on estimated SNP effects, not on the comprehensive
simulation of gene expression data.
